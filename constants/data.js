      `Personally, I may not know all the languages and be familiar with a tonne of dependancies, but it doesn't mean I can't code.`,
      `Because I want to code, I figure things out, I find solutions, I make it taste nice sometimes. It doesn't matter if I know recipes off by heart.`,
      `For be I love to code, because I get to experiment, problem solve, ask questions, reflect. And the more I do it, the better it tastes.`,
      // `What's important for me in life is to be reflective, open and continuously developing. is to continue learning with interest. Development and crypto interests me the most.`,
      // `My creative background has served me well, from making films to running ads, as now I get to combine design and the new found love challenge of coding as I aim to be a web3 dev.`,
      // `I'm involved with crypto projects and love the space. Therefore very excited by this career trajectory.`,
