      "Alright folks, listen up! Here's my theory - ANYONE can code. Yeah, you heard me right. It's just like cooking in a lot of ways.",

      "You know how people say they can't cook? Well, it's not necessarily because they can't cook. It's because they don't want to do it!",

      "Now personally, I may not be fluent in all the programming languages out there or know every damn dependency, but that doesn't mean I can't code.",

      "The thing is, when you WANT to code, you figure things out. You find solutions. You make it taste nice sometimes. It's not about memorizing every recipe out there.",

      "For me, coding is like a passion. I love experimenting, problem-solving, asking questions, and reflecting on what I've learned. And the more I do it, the better it tastes.",
